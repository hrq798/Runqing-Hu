            <h2>Beginning: Dreaming in California’s Electrical Engineering World</h2>
            <p>In the fall of 2018, I stood on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), with the sea breeze brushing my face and sunlight pouring over me. At that moment, I knew my electrical engineering dream had begun. In the classroom, I was captivated by the world of circuits and chips. The first time I used an Arduino to light up a tiny bulb, my heart raced—the faint glow felt like it illuminated all my dreams about technology. Over those four years, I earned Dean’s Honors and recognition in the Engineering Honors Program, but what I remember most is the focus of debugging FPGA in the late-night lab, and the rhythm of my self-made electronic music during morning runs by the ocean. California taught me not just technology, but how to find freedom beyond the code.</p>

            <h2>Turning Point: Awakening from Tech to Business</h2>
            <p>In 2020, I started my first internship at JD Research Institute, diving into the e-commerce market of Southeast Asia. That was when I discovered that data could tell stories. Every user click, every shopping habit, pieced together the bigger picture of the market like a puzzle. I realized that technology, when paired with business, could truly change the world. Later, I joined DMALL, first as a product manager, then as a data analyst. In the bustling streets of Shenzhen and Chengdu, I analyzed competitors like 711 and Alibaba, optimizing the algorithms for the Dmall App to enhance user experience. I still remember the moment our algorithm boosted a product’s visibility, and the user conversion rate soared—I stood by the window of our Chengdu office, watching the night fall, feeling closer to my dreams than ever.</p>
            <p>In 2023, I interned at Guotai Junan Securities in investment banking, working on IPO projects for Xuzhou Ruima and Jiangsu Jingchuang Electric. In the late-night meeting rooms, my team and I analyzed market sizes, competitive landscapes, and financial audits, crafting over 20 pages of presentations. Behind those numbers and charts was my newfound understanding of the business world—technology is a tool, but business is the stage. I was learning how to dance on that stage.</p>

            <h2>Passion: Igniting Life with Data</h2>
            <p>In 2023, I joined a statistical research project at Johns Hopkins University, using multiple linear regression to analyze Google stock data and predict future price trends. Every day, staring at the numbers on my screen, I felt like I was having a conversation with the future. When the paper got accepted at an international conference, I stood on the streets of Chengdu, looking up at the starry sky, feeling my dreams within reach. In 2024, I arrived at the University of Hong Kong’s Faculty of Business and Economics, pursuing a Master’s in Business Analytics. Under Hong Kong’s neon lights, I continued exploring the magic of data, but what truly made me happy was sweating it out on the basketball court, editing videos with friends, or feeling the wind rush past me on the track. Data is my language, but basketball, electronic music, and life itself—they’re my fire.</p>
